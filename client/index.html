        <h3>Step 1: Create Skill</h3>
        <p>
          Once you login to the Alexa Developer Console, select "Create skill"
        </p>
        <span
          >Name your skill in the "Skill Name" box, while leaving the default
          language as your locale</span
        >
        <div>Choose Alexa-Hosted (Node.js) for backend resources</div>
        <div>
          Once those are selected, click "Create Skill" at the top of the page.
        </div>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/create-new-skill.png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <div>
          Once the skill is created, under "Build" you'll see autogenerated
          intents. This will be what phrases Alexa will redirect to your skill.
        </div>
        <img src="assets/Intent-page.png" />
        <div>
          The more phrases you add, the more likely Alexa is to route your
          requests correctly. Since natural language varies, try adding as many
          variations as possible. If you need to collect information from the
          user before triggering your skill, you can add slots to your intent.
          As you see below, we are collecting a timeframe slot from the user
        </div>
        <img src="assets/intent-example.png" />
        <div>
          <h3>Adding an Intent Slot</h3>
          To collect information from the user during the skill trigger, add a
          Slot right below your intents. From there you can create a slot and
          tell your intent what the type is (Date, number, string, etc)
